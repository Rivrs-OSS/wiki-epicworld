## <mark style="color:green;">Jobs boosts</mark>

To help players progress faster in their professions and increase their earnings, **Evolucraft** offers special boosters.&#x20;

These boosters can be activated for a limited time and provide various benefits, such as:

* <mark style="color:green;">**Global Boosters:**</mark> EpicWorld offers two global boosters that benefit all players on the server:
  * <mark style="color:green;">**Global Knowledge Booster:**</mark> Increases experience gained in all professions by 20% for all players on the server. Take advantage of this experience boost to progress more quickly in your professions and unlock new skills.
  * <mark style="color:green;">**Global Wealth Booster:**</mark> Increases money earned in all professions by 20% for all players on the server. With this booster, you can accumulate wealth faster while practicing your favorite jobs.

{% hint style="success" %}
The boosters are activated by a single player and benefit the entire server!
{% endhint %}

Boosters can be obtained in various ways, such as quest rewards, purchases in the server shop, or special events.

Once activated, boosters remain active for a set period, allowing players to maximize their efficiency during this time.

## <mark style="color:green;">Information on the Different Boosts</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Companion Boosts:**</mark> Companion boosts stack when multiple companions are active at the same time.

For example, if you have two active companions, the boosts they provide will be combined to enhance your benefits.\


<mark style="color:green;">**Reward Boosts:**</mark> Regarding the reward boosts available on the server—those obtained through quests, profession tiers, and crates—the rule is that if multiple boosts are active on your character, only the most powerful boost will be applied.\
This means that if you have several active boosts, the one offering the greatest benefits will be the one that takes effect.\


<mark style="color:green;">**Shop Boosts:**</mark> Regarding the boosts obtained in the shop, it's important to note that, unlike companion boosts and boosts from quests or profession tiers, shop boosts do not stack with each other.

Only the most powerful boost you have activated will be considered to enhance your performance.\


<mark style="color:green;">**Boost Stacking:**</mark> The three types of boosts available on the server (companion boosts, boosts from quests, profession tiers, and crates, and shop boosts) stack together to provide cumulative benefits.
