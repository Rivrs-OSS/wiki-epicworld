## <mark style="color:green;">Auction House</mark>

As for the server's custom items, they can be bought and sold through the Auction House interface. This interface is divided into several sections:

* <mark style="color:green;">**Global**</mark>: Lists all items for sale in the <mark style="color:green;">**`/ah`**</mark>, sorted by the date of listing.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Weapons**</mark>: Groups various weapons available for purchase, such as swords, bows, etc.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Tools**</mark>: A category dedicated to tools, including pickaxes, shovels, hoes, etc.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Companions**</mark>: Section for buying or selling companions or "pets".
* <mark style="color:green;">**Classes**</mark>: Cards for the available character classes.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Blocks**</mark>: Lists blocks available for purchase for construction or decoration.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Spawners**</mark>: Displays spawners available for purchase to generate creatures.

The two buttons at the bottom of the interface allow players to manage their sales first, and then collect the items they have purchased.

## <mark style="color:green;">General Shop</mark>

On EpicWorld, you can easily access the spawn market by using the <mark style="color:green;">**`/shop`**</mark> command. It's the ideal place to sell your materials to NPCs. However, keep in mind that the profitability is quite low. Also, note that you cannot buy items in this shop. You can also sell some specific items for a higher price that changes every day with <mark style="color:green;">**`/merchant`**</mark>

These buyers specialize in purchasing different categories of products:

* <mark style="color:green;">**Mineral Buyer**</mark>: Mineral resources such as iron, gold, diamond, etc.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Block Buyer**</mark>: Various types of blocks for construction and decoration.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Utility Item Buyer**</mark>: Redstone components used to create mechanisms.

## <mark style="color:green;">**Player-to-Player Trades**</mark>

Players can also make direct trades with each other using the command <mark style="color:green;">**`/trade "username"`**</mark>. This allows for transactions of goods or purchases of items directly between two players.

## <mark style="color:green;">Auction</mark>

* The auctions are a daily event available at 7:00 PM, offering players the chance to win unique items through an auction interface. To keep the rarity of items in check, there will be 5 items available for auction each day. These may include cosmetics, rank-up items, upgradeable tools, spawners, scrolls, Elytras, and grappling hooks.
* This feature provides players with an exciting opportunity to bid on valuable items, with the auction offering a rotating selection to keep things fresh and interesting.
