# 🌍 The Worlds

As you begin your adventure on the server, you will quickly realize the importance of collecting resources to enrich your gaming experience.

The command <mark style="color:green;">**`/world`**</mark> allows you to navigate between the different available worlds.

The <mark style="color:green;">**Build**</mark> world opens the doors to an area where creating your city becomes possible. Here, only constructions within the framework of a city are allowed, and it is not possible to place blocks without claiming a territory.

In the <mark style="color:green;">**Resources**</mark> world, you'll find your first raw materials. It's the ideal place to mine ores and gather natural resources to support your progress.

The <mark style="color:green;">**Nether**</mark> world, accessible from the Experienced rank, is filled with valuable resources.

Finally, the <mark style="color:green;">**End**</mark> world, accessible from the Veteran rank, houses the rarest and most coveted resources.
